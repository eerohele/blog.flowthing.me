REPL is short for "read-eval-print loop". Many programming languages purport [to](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/jshell/introduction-jshell.html#GUID-630F27C8-1195-4989-9F6B-2C51D46F52C8) [have](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html#repl) [one](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/kotlin-repl.html#kotlin-repl). Here's a rough sketch of how the REPL works in most languages:

1. **Read** a chunk of user input into memory.
2. **Evaluate** the read string.
3. **Print** a string representation of the evaluation result.
4. **Loop** back to the beginning.

It is rare that you are able to (or indeed interested in) altering any of these steps. What would it even mean to swap out the "read" step of a Node.js or Kotlin REPL for something else?

In [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and other [Lisps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)), the R, E, and P in REPL are discrete and exchangeable steps. You can, for example, make an R that throws an exception if the code you give it uses a deprecated function. You can make an E that evaluates everything it receives in the context of the [dynamic bindings of your preference](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/2a058814e5fa3e8fb630ae507c3fa7dc865138c6/src/clj/clojure/main.clj#L82C1-L95). Or, you can make a P that, instead of printing the evaluation result into [standard output](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Standard-Streams.html#index-stdout), stores all evaluation results in a database, or sends the result to the data visualization tool of your choice.

The ability to swap in your own R, E and P mean that you can even reappropriate a Lisp REPL into something else altogether. You can turn one into a unit-aware calculator, an interpreter for a completely different language, or an interface for interacting with a large language model.

Let's first take a look at what each steps does. Then, we'll move on to why it matters.

<!--
You can make your own REPL that throws an exception if the form you try to evaluate calls a deprecated function, for example. Or, instead of printing the evaluation result into the [standard output](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Standard-Streams.html#index-stdout) stream, you can make a REPL that stores all evaluation results in a database, or sends the result to the data visualization tool of your choice.

To run a new REPL, you need not abandon your existing REPL. Instead, you reappropriate

The ability to do this relies on the simplicity of the protocol the REPL uses for both input and output. Contrast this with RPC-style protocols like nREPL. nREPL is short for "Network REPL". "Not a REPL" would be a more fitting moniker.

<aside>Do not construe this as a criticism of nREPL. nREPL is a fine tool, and one for whose existence the Clojure community can be grateful for.</aside>

```clojure
;; Input
{:op "eval" :code "(inc 1)"}

;; Output
{:session "4cee2336-1977-4049-af82-5c5e8ecfeebe", :ns "user", :value "2"}
{:session "4cee2336-1977-4049-af82-5c5e8ecfeebe", :status #{:done}}
```

In fact, the ability to swap out the first three letters in "REPL" means that you can reappropriate a Lisp REPL into something else altogether. You can turn one into a unit-aware calculator, an interpreter for a completely different language, or an interface for interacting with a large language model.
-->

<!--
You can even turn a Clojure REPL into a Java, uh, "REPL", if you want. Behold:

```clojure
(let [jshell (jdk.jshell.JShell/create)
      eval-counter (atom 0)]
  (clojure.main/repl
    :init
    (fn [] (reset! eval-counter 0))

    :prompt
    (fn []
      (print "\njshell> ")
      (flush))

    :read
    (fn [_ request-exit]
      (let [input (read-line)]
        ;; Ctrl+D to exit
        (if (nil? input)
          request-exit
          input)))

    :eval
    (fn [string] (.eval jshell string))

    :print
    (fn [events]
      (run!
        (fn [event]
          (println (str "$" (swap! eval-counter inc)) "==>" (.value event)))
        events))))
```

You can then bask in Java's exactitude and pith from the comfort of your Clojure REPL:

```java
jshell> import java.util.stream.Collectors;
$1 ==> nil
jshell> import java.util.stream.Stream;
$2 ==> nil
jshell> var stream = Stream.of("a", "b", "c");
$3 ==> java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$Head@64bfbc86
jshell> stream.filter(s -> s.contains("b")).collect(Collectors.toList());
$4 ==> [b]
```

In contrast, reading, evaluation, and printing are not discrete steps in JShell and its ilk. You cannot nest a Clojure REPL within JShell.

<!--
In this article, I aim to demonstrate what sets Lisp REPLs apart from interactive shells most other languages have. My background is in Clojure. I'll therefore use Clojure in all code examples in this article. I have little to no experience with Common Lisp, Scheme, or other precursors of Clojure. I am aware that Common Lisp, for example, has a more sophisticated REPL than Clojure, but I'm unqualified to discuss the particulars of that subject.
-->

## Read

The *read* step of REPLs is often taken to mean "to read a line from standard (or other) input". In Clojure and other Lisps, however, "reading" has a specific meaning. The [`read`](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node188.html#SECTION002611000000000000000) function takes a group of characters and turns them into something called a **form**. In Clojure, a [form](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node56.html#SECTION00910000000000000000) is any value Clojure can evaluate to produce a new value. Here are examples of forms:

- `42`
- `filter`
- `{:a :b}`
- `(+ 1 2)`

Here's an example of reading a form from a string:

```clojure
user=> (read-string "(+ 1 2 3)")
(+ 1 2 3)
```

Here, `read-string` returns the form `(+ 1 2 3)`. It is an immutable list you can manipulate using the functions in the Clojure standard library. For example, given `(+ 1 2 3)`, you can change the plus to a minus:

```clojure
;; *1 is a reference to the previous evaluation result; here, (+ 1 2 3).
;;
;; cons is a function that, given a value and a list, prepends the value into
;; the list.
;;
;; rest is a function that returns its input, sans the first element (in this
;; case, (1 2 3).
user=> (cons '- (rest *1))
(- 1 2 3)
```

This is obviously not a useful example. Its point is to demonstrate the malleability that having a distinct reading step offers.

The ability to `read` in this manner is only available to languages that [use the same data structures for both code and data](https://www.expressionsofchange.org/dont-say-homoiconic). Languages such as Java or Node.js therefore do not support "reading" in the sense Lisps do. For example, if you type `1 + 2 + 3` into a Node.js interpreter, Node.js does not first turn the string `1 + 2 + 3` into [a JavaScript array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) of items you would then be able to manipulate using the array manipulation methods built into JavaScript. The concept of "reading" in this sense does not exists

Reading being a distinct step means you can extend the default `read` implementation or replace it with your own. For example, you can make a reader function that it otherwise the same as the regular `read` function, except that it throws an exception if you try using a deprecated function or macro.

<!--

Here's a Clojure function that, given a form, throws an exception if there's a reference to a deprecated [Var](https://clojure.org/reference/vars) anywhere in the form. (Understanding the function requires some fluency in Clojure. If you don't have that, just skip it: the implementation details are not important here.)

```clojure
(defn throw-on-deprecated
  "Given a form, throw an exception if the form refers to a deprecated var."
  [form]
  (when (seq? form)
    (clojure.walk/prewalk
      (fn [form]
        (when (symbol? form)
          (let [v (resolve form)]
            (when (-> v meta :deprecated)
              (throw (ex-info (format "Call to deprecated var: %s." (pr-str v))
                       {:var v})))))))))
```

To use the function above, you'd use `clojure.main/repl`, which allows you to swap out your own implementations of reading, evaluation, and printing:

```clojure
;; Run a new REPL that throws an exception when it reads a form that refers to
;; a deprecated var.
user=> (clojure.main/repl
         :read
         (fn [_ _]
           (doto (read *in*) throw-on-deprecated)))
user=> (inc 1)
2
user=> (replicate 1 2)
```

Yields:

```
Execution error (ExceptionInfo) at user/eval8195$fn$fn (user:NO_SOURCE_FILE).
Call to deprecated var: #'clojure.core/replicate.
```

-->

## Evaluate

The `eval` function accepts a form and returns data.

<!-- binding example! e.g. print-length, etc. maybe warn-on-reflection? -->
<!-- The only limits that apply to customizing your REPL are the limits of your programming language. -->

Given:

```clojure
(clojure.main/repl
  :eval
  (fn [form]
    (binding [*warn-on-reflection* true]
      (let [ret (eval form)]
        ;; Some REPL implementations don't auto-flush after writing to the
        ;; error stream. We'll therefore flush manually after
        ;; evaluation to make sure the reflection warning becomes
        ;; visible.
        (flush *err*)
        ret))))
```

Then:

```clojure
(defn upper-case
  [s]
  (.toUpperCase s))
```

Yields:

```
Reflection warning, my.clj:3:3 - reference to field toUpperCase can't be resolved.
#'user/upper-case
```

## Print

```clojure
(clojure.main/repl
  :print (fn [value] (tab.api/tab> user/tab value)))

(clojure.reflect/reflect java.time.Clock)
```

Being a Lisp, Clojure has a plethora of REPLs. It has [nREPL](https://nrepl.org), which is probably the most widely used tool of any kind in the entire Clojure ecosystem. Clojure has a built-in [REPL](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.main-api.html#clojure.main/repl), which you can [serve over a network socket](https://clojure.org/reference/repl_and_main#_launching_a_socket_server). Clojure also has [prepl](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core.server/prepl), a (strangely underdocumented) REPL that almost no one uses, which yields "structured output (for programs)." There's also [Unrepl](https://github.com/Unrepl/unrepl), which upgrades Clojure's built-in REPL or (nREPL, somehow, apparently) to use an extensible protocol for communicating with the Clojure runtime.

For the past couple of years, Iâ€™ve been on this foolâ€™s errand to make [my favorite text editor](https://www.sublimetext.com) a viable alternative for programming Clojure.

Like with most projects, in the beginning, I had no idea what I was doing. (Iâ€™m not sure I still do, to be honest.) All I knew was that I wanted to evaluate Clojure code directly from my editor and see the result.
-->

<!--
Like, I wanted to be able to do things like this:

First, I want to write a function definition in my editor, like this:

![REPL](images/repl-1.png)

Then, I want to be able to write code that calls that function

![REPL](images/repl-2.png)

Finally, I want to be able to execute that function call by hitting a key binding in my editor and have the result show up in my editor.


![REPL](images/repl-3.png)

 Iâ€™ve since realized that back then, and for a long time after, I didnâ€™t even know what a REPL actually was. Most Clojure programmers, Iâ€™m sure, are in the same boat.

Most programmers have probably never really even thought about it too much, really. I mean, a REPL is this thing where type code and the computer gives you back the result. Right? Thatâ€™s the way I thought about it, at least.

  # What's in a REPL?

Most programmers recognize the acronym "REPL". When they hear "REPL", they think of this thing where you type in code and the computer prints the answer. You know, [`irb`](https://github.com/ruby/irb) for Ruby, [GHCi](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/ghci.html) for Haskell, [`node`](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html#repl_repl) for Node.js, and so on.

- irb, GHCi, etc. don't really have R
  - typing code into these has different semantics than specifying code in files
  - Rubyists, Haskellers, etc. typically don't sit at their interactive prompts all day every day developing programs
  - cf. Lisp
- What is "Socket REPL"
  - socket server is actually a more generic thing
  - prepl is just a different accept function
- nREPL is not really a REPL
  - "E" is not really "E"
